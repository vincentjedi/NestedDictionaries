A dictionary is a type of data structure and also a collection of unique keys and their values.
A nested dictionary is simply a dictionary within a dictionary.
A simple dictionary is illustrated below:

Below is a single dictionary
{
    key 1: value 1,
    key 2: value 2
}


Below is a nested dictionary. Nesting of a list within a dictionary is also possible.
{
    key 1: {dictionary1},
    key 2: {dictionary2},
    key 3: [list]
}
